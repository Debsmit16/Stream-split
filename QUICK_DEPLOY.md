## Step 2: Deploy Contract to Celo Mainnet

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: You Need Real CELO Tokens

**Before deploying to mainnet:**
- You need ~0.5-1 CELO for gas fees
- This costs real money (unlike testnet)
- Only deploy when you're ready for production

### Get CELO Tokens:
1. Buy from exchanges: Coinbase, Binance, OKX
2. Withdraw to your deployer wallet address
3. Check `.env` in `packages/hardhat` for your address

### Deploy Command:

```bash
# From project root
cd packages/hardhat

# Check your balance first (you need CELO!)
npx hardhat run scripts/check-balance.ts --network celo

# Deploy to Celo Mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network celo

# Save the contract address shown in terminal!
```

### After Deployment:

1. **Verify Contract**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network celo YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
   ```

2. **Update Frontend**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to your new address
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK` to "celo"
   - Redeploy
