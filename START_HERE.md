---

## ✅ Step 1: Deploy Frontend to Vercel (5 Minutes)

### Option A: One-Click Deploy (Easiest)

1. **Click this button (after creating it on Vercel)**:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/new
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "Import" next to "Debsmit16/Stream-split"

2. **Configure the deployment**:
   ```
   ✓ Root Directory: packages/react-app ← IMPORTANT!
   ✓ Framework: Next.js
   ✓ Build Command: npm run build
   ✓ Output Directory: .next
   ✓ Install Command: npm install
   ```

3. **Add Environment Variables** (Click "Environment Variables"):
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID = 245ad129f4e05f4025acb312a2df7e5c
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 0x28f8aE58a76aEe9024e4a823af429831c6173029
   NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK = alfajores
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes ⏱️
   - Your app is LIVE! 🎉

### What You'll Get:
```
✅ Live URL: https://stream-split-xyz.vercel.app
✅ Automatic HTTPS/SSL
✅ Global CDN
✅ Auto-deploy on every git push
✅ PWA features enabled
✅ Mobile responsive
```

---

## 📋 Step 2: Test Your Deployed App

Once deployed, test these features:

1. ✅ **Open the URL** Vercel gives you
2. ✅ **Connect your wallet** (MetaMask/WalletConnect)
3. ✅ **Switch to Alfajores network**
4. ✅ **Try Employer Dashboard** (/employer)
5. ✅ **Try Worker Dashboard** (/worker)
6. ✅ **Test PWA install** (on mobile/desktop)

---

## 💡 Step 3: Deploy Smart Contract to Mainnet (Optional)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This costs real money! Only do this when you're ready for production.

### What You Need:
- 💰 **~1 CELO token** (~$0.50-2 depending on price)
- 🔑 **Private key** with funds (check `.env` in `packages/hardhat/`)
- ✅ **Tested everything** on Alfajores first

### Where to Get CELO:
1. **Buy on exchanges**: Coinbase, Binance, OKX
2. **Withdraw to your wallet**: Use the address from your `.env` PRIVATE_KEY
3. **Check balance**: `npx hardhat run scripts/check-balance.ts --network celo`

### Deploy Commands:

```bash
# Navigate to hardhat package
cd packages/hardhat

# Check your balance (must have CELO!)
npx hardhat run scripts/check-balance.ts --network celo

# Deploy to Celo Mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network celo

# You'll see:
# ✅ StreamSplit deployed to: 0xYOUR_NEW_ADDRESS
# SAVE THIS ADDRESS!

# Verify on Celoscan
npx hardhat verify --network celo 0xYOUR_NEW_ADDRESS
```

### After Mainnet Deployment:

1. **Update Vercel Environment Variables**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Update these:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 0xYOUR_NEW_MAINNET_ADDRESS
     NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK = celo
     ```
   - Click "Save"
   - Redeploy: Deployments → ⋯ → Redeploy

2. **Test with Real CELO**:
   - Use SMALL amounts first!
   - Create a test stream with 0.001 CELO/hour
   - Verify everything works
